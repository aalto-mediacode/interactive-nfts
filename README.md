# Introduction
Interactive NFTs is a project by Erik Zuuring for the Generative Media Coding 2021 course. The goal of this project was to explore ways that we can engage with this new medium for digital media. I wanted to work with the possibilities of using image formats, in this case SVGs, to experiment with interactive elements. 

# About the code
This project was built using p5.js which is loaded directly into a .svg file format. This allows you to create an interactive image for support on NFT community hicetnunc.xyz. When looking at the .svg files, you can see that the p5.js was directly inserted with the custom JS inserted at the bottom lines of code.

# NFT and the environment
A lot of discussion has arisen from the boom of NFTs in terms of the ecological footprint. For this project, it was deployed onto the TEZOS blockchain which uses 0.0002333333% less power consumption (0.0782/kWh approx.) than the main NFT network, Ethereum (ETH).

# Where to view pieces
The pieces are currently listed on NFT community hicetnunc.xyz, however for academic reasons they are not for sale!
